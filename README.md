A bit of everything really - web dev/design, generally programming, video editing, translation, music, 3D design, whatever-ish else.

I'm an unclassifiable undecided entity but I mostly do front-end dev and design. My public repos are sorted neatly in the [stars](https://github.com/maksiksq?tab=stars) tab, so you might want to check that out.
